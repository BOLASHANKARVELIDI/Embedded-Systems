Q).  What is Microcontroller?
A).  A microcontroller is a chip optimized to control electronic devices. It is stored in a single integrated circuit which is dedicated to performing a particular task and execute one specific application.It is specially designed circuits for embedded applications and is widely used in automatically controlled electronic devices. It contains memory, processor, and programmable I/O.
				----------MICROCONTROLLER ::	..(MicroProcesser + Memory Allocation)..---------
-> A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals.
->Microcontrollers are used in automatically controlled products and devices, such as automobile engine control systems, implantable medical devices, remote controls, office machines, appliances, power tools, toys and other embedded systems.
->By reducing the size and cost compared to a design that uses a separate microprocessor, memory, and input/output devices, microcontrollers make it economical to digitally control even more devices and processes. 
->A microcontroller can be considered a self-contained system with a processor, memory and peripherals and can be used as an embedded system.
->The majority of microcontrollers in use today are embedded in other machinery, such as automobiles, telephones, appliances, and peripherals for computer systems.



Q).  What is a Microprocessor?
A).  A microprocessor is a controlling unit of a micro-computer wrapped inside a small chip. It performs Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU) operations and communicates with the other devices connected with it. It is a single Integrated Circuit in which several functions are combined.
					------------MICROPROCESSOR ::------------
->The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit. 
->The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form) as output. 
->Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.


			---------Types of Microprocessor------
Important types of Microprocessors are:
->  Complex Instruction Set Microprocessors
->  The Application Specific Integrated Circuit
->  Reduced Instruction Set Microprocessors
->  Digital Signal Multiprocessors (DSPs)

		------Types of Microcontroller----------
Here are important types of Microcontroller:
*->  8 bit Microcontroller : 8 bits accessed at a time [ EX: PIC,ARUDINO,NODE MCU ,etc  ]
*->  16 bit Microcontroller : 16 bits at a time accessed [ EX: ATMEL2500  ]
*->  32 bit Microcontroller : 32 bits at a time accessed [ EX; STM32,LPC2124,LPC2148,etc  ]
->  Embedded Microcontroller
->  External memory Microcontroller

*-->> TO display the name,nearly 50 line of the code is used in PIC micro controller..
*-->> To display the name,2 lines of code is used in AURDINO.
*-->AURDINO is open source [i.e Everything means CODE is available in net ]
*-->PIC is not an open source [i.e you need to the code physically everything..  ]
